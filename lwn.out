        Many community-based Linux distributions have made the decision to switch
to systemd, and most of those decisions were accompanied by lengthy,
sometimes acrimonious mailing-list discussions. No distribution had a
harder time of it than Debian, though, where arguments raged through much
of 2013 before the Debian Technical Committee <a
href="/Articles/585319/">decided</a> on systemd in early 2014.  Thereafter,
it is fair to say,
appetite for renewing the init-system discussion has been low.  Now,
though, the topic has returned to the fore and
it would appear that the project is heading toward a new general
resolution to decide at what level init systems other than systemd should
be supported.

        A set of patches has just been pushed into the mainline repository (and
stable updates) for yet
another set of hardware vulnerabilities.  "TSX async abort" (or TAA)
exposes information through the usual side channels by way of internal
buffers used with the transactional memory (TSX) instructions.  Mitigation
is done by disabling TSX or by clearing the relevant buffers when switching
between kernel and user mode.  Given that this is not the first problem
with TSX, disabling it entirely is recommended; a microcode update may be
needed to do so, though.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a7a248c593e4">This commit</a> contains
documentation on this vulnerability and its mitigation.
<p>
There are also fixes for <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7f00cc8d4a51">another vulnerability</a>:
it seems that accessing a memory address immediately after the size of the
page containing it was changed (from a regular to a huge page, for
example) can cause the processor to lock up.  This behavior is considered
undesirable by many.  The vulnerability only
exists for pages marked as executable; the mitigation is to force all
executable pages to be the regular, 4K page size.

        Operating systems and computing hardware both carry a lot of their history
with them.  The x86 I/O-port mechanism is one piece of that history; it is
rarely used by hardware designed in the last 20 years, but it must
still be supported.  That doesn't mean that this support can't be cleaned
up and improved, though, especially when the old implementation turns out
to have some unpleasant properties.  An example can be seen in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191106193459.581614484@linutronix.de/">the
<tt>iopl()</tt> patch set</a> from Thomas Gleixner.

        As of this writing, just over 14,000 non-merge changesets have found their
way into the mainline repository for the 5.4 release; that is a bit less
than we saw for 5.3, but more than most of the other recent kernels.  The
final 5.4 release is approaching, so it must be time for our usual look at
where the code merged in this development cycle came from.  It's mostly
business as usual in the kernel community, modulo an appearance from none
other than Hulk Robot.

each new device chronologically to that page, highlighting the newest

        Running untrusted code in a safe manner is generally the goal of sandboxing
efforts.  The sandbox technique presented by Georgia Tech PhD student
Ashish Bijlani at <a 
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">Open 
Source Summit Europe 2019</a> is no exception.  He has used something of a novel
scheme to allow unprivileged code to implement the sandbox policies using
BPF; the policies are then enforced by the kernel.

        Linux systems have traditionally run with a single address space that
is shared by  user and kernel space.  That changed with the advent of the
Meltdown 
vulnerability, which forced the merging of <a
href="/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a> (KPTI) at the end of
2017.  But, Mike Rapoport said during his <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">2019
Open Source Summit Europe</a> 
talk, that may not be the end of the story for address-space isolation.
There is a good case to be made for increasing the separation of address
spaces, but implementing that may require some fundamental changes in how
kernel memory management works.

        The stable kernel releases are meant to contain as many important fixes as
possible; to that end, the stable maintainers have been <a

machine-learning system</a> to identify patches that should be considered for a
stable update.  This exercise has had some success but, at the 2019 Open
Source Summit Europe, Sasha Levin asked whether this process could be
improved further.  Might it be possible for a machine-learning system to
identify patches that <i>create</i> bugs and intercept them, so that the
fixes never become necessary?

        The kernel project's email-based development process is well established

understand that.  It is one thing, though, to establish goals for an
